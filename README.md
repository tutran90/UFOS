# **UFO Finder**

## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this project was to help develop a webpage that would display a set of Javascript array. The display would consist of a tale where users had the ability to filter their search by date, city, state, shape, and country. Javascript was used during this project to build a code that would filter the data for us. Bootstrap and CSS was used to help style the index.html file. 

## **Results**
Javascript was used to help the code to filter through the Javascript array. Users are able to filter by date. In order to filter by date users will need to input a date in the same format as the placeholder example that can be seen in the input box. ![date](https://github.com/tutran90/UFOS/blob/main/Search_date.png)

Users can also filter by city. Again, in order for the city to populate they would need to follow the smae format as the placeholder that can be seen in the input box. ![city](https://github.com/tutran90/UFOS/blob/main/Search_city.png)

The other filters that can be used include state, country, and shape (of the UFO). According to what is entered in the input field, the code will run and display a match on the table beside it. More than one filter can also used at one time. ![time](https://github.com/tutran90/UFOS/blob/main/Search_multi.png)

## **Summary**
The webpage that was created is quite impressive however there are some drawbacks. For example. the webpage's filter table is case sensitive. If the user does not input the correct format, then the data will not be displayed correctly. It would be nice and more versatile if we could build a code to handle the case sensitivity. 

### **Recommendations to Enhance the Webpage**
In order to keep this webpage more current, it should be linked to a website (such as NASA) and scrapping could be done to pull in more current information. This webpage is very limited since it will only pull what information it has from the Javascript array which is already set. 

The styling could be adjusted to create a more pronouce button, instead of just filtering based on what is texted in the input box. In addition to what was mentioned above, if we were able to build a code that linked it to a well known organization, we could have UFO pictures appear in the table (if it is available).
